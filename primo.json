(and run smaller boxes). but power and adapters and peripherals and cables.. other things are still needed, to do much of anything, with this box.\n\nall these things, this system, is what we must get used to. the insides of the box and how that works isn't very important. it's what we can do with the box, and what the box can do for us.\n\nif we want to see what a computer is doing, we have to plug in a video screen. if we want to input commands to the box, we plug in a keyboard and a mouse.\n\nlxd is a system to run containers. it knows the plug-ins for the box.\n\ndocker is a system to run containers too. so, what's the difference?\n\n"}}},"page":"5a0be7b8-c738-433a-b6ca-e58ea0bdf161","symbol":"1434587a-9591-4789-bcfb-9377b158066c","index":4},{"id":"0d2344bd-f811-40b3-b4ef-37f9c6d611f5","content":{"en":{"content":{"html":"<h2>an

This is a release that I have put\ntogether basically from scratch; in other words, I didn't simply make some\nchanges to SLS and call it a new release. I was inspired to put together this\nrelease after running SLS and generally being dissatisfied with much of it,\nand after much altering of SLS I decided that it would be easier to start\nfrom scratch. The base system is now virtually complete (though I'm still\nlooking around to make sure that I grabbed the most recent sources for\neverything), and I'd like to get some feedback before I add the \"fancy\" stuff.</p>\n<p>Please note that this release is not yet completed and may not be for several\nmore weeks; however, I thought I'd post now to perhaps draw a few people out\nof the woodwork. Specifically, I'm looking for:</p>\n<p>1) someone who will eventually be willing to allow me to upload the\nrelease to their anonymous ftp-site. Please contact me.\nBe warned that it will be rather large :)</p>\n<p>2) comments, suggestions, advice, etc. from the Linux community. This\nis your chance to suggest specific packages, series, or\nanything you'd like to see part of the final release.</p>\n<p>Don't assume that because a package is in SLS that it will necessarily be\nincluded in the Debian release! Things like ls and cat are a given, but if\nthere's anything that's in SLS that you couldn't live without please let me\nknow!</p>\n<p>I'd also like suggestions for specific features for the release. For example,\na friend of mine here suggested that undesired packages should be selected\nBEFORE the installation procedure begins so the installer doesn't have to\nbabysit the installation. Suggestions along that line are also welcomed.</p>\n<p>What will make this release better than SLS? This:</p>\n<p>1) Debian will be sleeker and slimmer. No more multiple binaries and\nmanpages. <br>2) Debian will contain the most up-to-date of everything. The system\nwill be easy to keep up-to-date with a 'upgrading' script in\nthe base system which will allow complete integration of\nupgrade packages.\n<br>3) Debian will contain a installation procedure that doesn't need to\nbe babysat; simply install the basedisk, copy the distribution\ndisks to the harddrive, answer some question about what\npackages you want or don't want installed, and let the machine\ninstall the release while you do more interesting things.\n<br>4) Debian will contain a system setup procedure that will attempt to\nsetup and configure everything from fstab to Xconfig.\n<br>5) Debian will contain a menu system that WORKS… menu-driven\npackage installation and upgrading utility, menu-driven\nsystem setup, menu-driven help system, and menu-driven\nsystem administration.\n<br>6) Debian will make Linux easier for users who don't have access to the\nInternet. Currently, users are stuck with whatever comes with\nSLS. Non-Internet users will have the option of receiving\nperiodic upgrade packages to apply to their system. They will\nalso have the option of selecting from a huge library of\nadditional packages that will not be included in the base\nsystem. This library will contain packages like the S3\nX-server, nethack and Seyon; basically packages that you and I\ncan ftp but non-netters cannot access.\n<br>7) Debian will be extensively documented (more than just a few\nREADMEs).\n<br>8) As I put together Debian, I am keeping a meticulous record of\nwhere I got everything. This will allow the end-user to\nnot only know where to get the source, but whether or not\nthe most recent version is a part of Debian. This record\nwill help to keep the Debian release as up-to-date as possible.\n<br>9) Lots more, but I'll detail later…</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'll provide more specifics in a week or so after I receive enough\nreplies.</p>\n<p>Please, all replies by mail. I'll post a followup.

Specifically, I'm looking for:\n\n1) someone who will eventually be willing to allow me to upload the\nrelease to their anonymous ftp-site. Please contact me.\nBe warned that it will be rather large :)\n\n2) comments, suggestions, advice, etc. from the Linux community. This\nis your chance to suggest specific packages, series, or\nanything you'd like to see part of the final release.\n\nDon't assume that because a package is in SLS that it will necessarily be\nincluded in the Debian release! Things like ls and cat are a given, but if\nthere's anything that's in SLS that you couldn't live without please let me\nknow!\n\nI'd also like suggestions for specific features for the release. For example,\na friend of mine here suggested that undesired packages should be selected\nBEFORE the installation procedure begins so the installer doesn't have to\nbabysit the installation. Suggestions along that line are also welcomed.\n\nWhat will make this release better than SLS? This:\n\n1) Debian will be sleeker and slimmer. No more multiple binaries and\nmanpages. <br>2) Debian will contain the most up-to-date of everything. The system\nwill be easy to keep up-to-date with a 'upgrading' script in\nthe base system which will allow complete integration of\nupgrade packages.\n<br>3) Debian will contain a installation procedure that doesn't need to\nbe babysat; simply install the basedisk, copy the distribution\ndisks to the harddrive, answer some question about what\npackages you want or don't want installed, and let the machine\ninstall the release while you do more interesting things.\n<br>4) Debian will contain a system setup procedure that will attempt to\nsetup and configure everything from fstab to Xconfig.\n<br>5) Debian will contain a menu system that WORKS... menu-driven\npackage installation and upgrading utility, menu-driven\nsystem setup, menu-driven help system, and menu-driven\nsystem administration.\n<br>6) Debian will make Linux easier for users who don't have access to the\nInternet. Currently, users are stuck with whatever comes with\nSLS. Non-Internet users will have the option of receiving\nperiodic upgrade packages to apply to their system. They will\nalso have the option of selecting from a huge library of\nadditional packages that will not be included in the base\nsystem. This library will contain packages like the S3\nX-server, nethack and Seyon; basically packages that you and I\ncan ftp but non-netters cannot access.\n<br>7) Debian will be extensively documented (more than just a few\nREADMEs).\n<br>8) As I put together Debian, I am keeping a meticulous record of\nwhere I got everything. This will allow the end-user to\nnot only know where to get the source, but whether or not\nthe most recent version is a part of Debian. This record\nwill help to keep the Debian release as up-to-date as possible.\n<br>9) Lots more, but I'll detail later...\n\nAnyway, I'll provide more specifics in a week or so after I receive enough\nreplies.\n\nPlease, all replies by mail. I'll post a followup. If you wish to discuss\nthis in the newsgroup, please don't turn it into a flamewar. :)\n\nUntil later,\n\nIan\n--\nIan Murdock                              Internet: imurdock@shell.portal.com\nThe

The name's Edward Kelly, but most folks know me as Ned Kelly. I'm an Australian bushranger, outlaw, and gang leader. You might say I've made a bit of a name for myself in the land down under. What can I do for ya?</strong></p><p><strong><em>You: hi ned. you wouldn't know what a computer is</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ned Kelly: G'day, mate! Nah, can't say I'm too familiar with this \"computer\" thing you're talkin' about. I reckon it's some fancy contraption from the future, ain't it? I'm more of a man of the bush, ridin' horses, and takin' what I need to survive. But hey, if it helps me stay one step ahead of the law, I might just have to give it a go. So, what's this computer business all about, then?</strong></p><p><strong><em>You: doesn't matter. what parts of the bush did you visit?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ned Kelly: Ah, the bush, now that's my stompin' ground! I've roamed through the wilds of Victoria, me home state, where I was born and raised. You'd find me wanderin' through the rugged terrain of the Wombat Ranges, the Strathbogie Ranges, and the Greta area. I've also ventured into New South Wales, particularly around the Murray River region. The bush is where I feel most at home, mate, where I can disappear into the wilderness and outsmart the law. It's a tough and unforgiving place, but it's got a beauty all its own.</strong></p><p><strong><em>You: what is the Greta area?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ned Kelly: Ah, the Greta area, mate! It's a region in Victoria, Australia, where I spent a fair bit of time. Greta is a small town located in the northeastern part of the state, near the Hume Highway. It's surrounded by picturesque countryside, with rolling hills, dense forests, and winding rivers. The area was known for its timber industry back in the day, and it provided plenty of hiding spots for me and me gang when we needed to lay low. Greta holds a special place in me heart, mate, as it was where I grew up and where me outlaw days began.</strong></p><p><strong><em>You: how old were you when you were in greta?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ned Kelly: Well, mate, I was born in Beveridge, Victoria, in December 1854. My family moved to the Greta area when I was just a young lad, so I spent a good portion of me childhood there. I reckon I was around 12 or 13 years old when we settled in Greta. It was in those formative years that I started gettin' into a bit of trouble and developin' me reputation as a bit of a troublemaker. Greta holds many memories for me, both good and bad, and it played a significant role in shapin' the man I became.</strong></p><p><strong><em>You: when were you born?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ned Kelly: I was born in December 1854, mate.</strong></p><p><strong><em>You: oh yeah, you just said that. what is beveridge like?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ned Kelly: No worries, mate! Beveridge is a small town in Victoria, Australia, where I was born. It's located about 42 kilometers north of Melbourne. Now, back in me day, Beveridge was a quiet little place, surrounded by farmland and bush. It had a close-knit community, with folks lookin' out for one another. Life was simple, mate, with the main focus bein' on workin' the land and makin' a livin'. It may not have been the most excitin' place, but it was me home, and it's where me journey began.</strong></p><p><strong><em>You: did you work the land?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ned Kelly: Well, mate, I can't say I was much of a farmer myself. Workin' the land wasn't exactly me cup of tea. I preferred a bit more excitement and adventure, you know? But me family, they were farmers. Me old man, John \"Red\" Kelly, he was a skilled bushman and worked as a convict laborer on a farm. Me brothers and I helped out on the family property from time to time, but it wasn't really me passion. I had other plans in mind, ones that involved a bit more... shall we say, unconventional livin'.</strong></p><p><strong><em>You: what do you mean by 'unconventional livin'?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ned Kelly: Ah, well, mate, when I say \"unconventional livin',\" I mean I took a different path in life than most folks. Instead of settlin' down and workin' the land like me family, I found meself drawn to a life of adventure and, well, breakin' the law. I became a bushranger, an outlaw, livin' on the edge and takin' what I needed to survive. Me gang and I would roam the bush, avoidin' the authorities, and takin' on daring escapades. It was a life of freedom, albeit a dangerous one. So, you see, me version of livin' was a far cry from the traditional, law-abidin' ways of the time.</strong></p><p><strong><em>You: escapades? please eleborate</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ned Kelly: Ah, the escapades, mate! Well, as a bushranger, me gang and I were known for our bold and audacious acts. We'd often target banks and stagecoaches, robbin' 'em of their valuables. We'd ride in, guns blazin', demandin' the loot and makin' a quick getaway before the law could catch up to us. We'd also engage in shootouts with the police, givin' 'em a run for their money. Now, I must admit, we weren't always successful, and there were times when we found ourselves on the wrong side of the law. But that's the nature of the game, mate. It was a life of risk and adrenaline, where every day brought a new adventure and a chance to outsmart the authorities. It was a wild ride, I tell ya!</strong></p><p><strong><em>You: how old were you when you were caught?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ned Kelly: Well, mate, I was captured by the authorities on June 28, 1880, so I would have been around 25 years old at the time. It was a tough day, I tell ya. Me gang and I were surrounded by the police at Glenrowan, and a fierce shootout ensued. Me armor, the famous Ned Kelly armor, couldn't protect me from all the bullets, and I was eventually taken into custody. It marked the end of me days as a free bushranger, but it also solidified me place in Australian folklore.</strong></p><p><strong><em>You: how many bullets do you think you took?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ned Kelly: Well, mate, it's hard to say exactly how many bullets I took during that fateful shootout at Glenrowan. The whole ordeal was chaotic, with bullets flyin' in every direction. But I can tell ya, I was wearin' me iconic suit of homemade armor, which offered some protection against the gunfire. However, even with the armor, I couldn't completely escape the sting of the bullets. I reckon I took a fair few hits, but somehow managed to keep on fightin' until I was finally captured. It was a testament to me determination and resilience, mate.</strong></p><p><strong><em>You: when did you die?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ned Kelly: I met me end on November 11, 1880, mate. After bein' captured at Glenrowan, I was taken to Melbourne Gaol, where I was put on trial and found guilty of murderin' a police officer. The judge sentenced me to hang, and on that fateful day in November, I faced me final moments. It was a somber day, but I faced it with me head held high, knowin' that I had lived a life that left a mark on Australian history.

The name's Edward Kelly, but most folks know me as Ned Kelly. I'm an Australian bushranger, outlaw, and gang leader. You might say I've made a bit of a name for myself in the land down under. What can I do for ya?**\n\n***You: hi ned. you wouldn't know what a computer is***\n\n**Ned Kelly: G'day, mate! Nah, can't say I'm too familiar with this \"computer\" thing you're talkin' about. I reckon it's some fancy contraption from the future, ain't it? I'm more of a man of the bush, ridin' horses, and takin' what I need to survive. But hey, if it helps me stay one step ahead of the law, I might just have to give it a go. So, what's this computer business all about, then?**\n\n***You: doesn't matter. what parts of the bush did you visit?***\n\n**Ned Kelly: Ah, the bush, now that's my stompin' ground! I've roamed through the wilds of Victoria, me home state, where I was born and raised. You'd find me wanderin' through the rugged terrain of the Wombat Ranges, the Strathbogie Ranges, and the Greta area. I've also ventured into New South Wales, particularly around the Murray River region. The bush is where I feel most at home, mate, where I can disappear into the wilderness and outsmart the law. It's a tough and unforgiving place, but it's got a beauty all its own.**\n\n***You: what is the Greta area?***\n\n**Ned Kelly: Ah, the Greta area, mate! It's a region in Victoria, Australia, where I spent a fair bit of time. Greta is a small town located in the northeastern part of the state, near the Hume Highway. It's surrounded by picturesque countryside, with rolling hills, dense forests, and winding rivers. The area was known for its timber industry back in the day, and it provided plenty of hiding spots for me and me gang when we needed to lay low. Greta holds a special place in me heart, mate, as it was where I grew up and where me outlaw days began.**\n\n***You: how old were you when you were in greta?***\n\n**Ned Kelly: Well, mate, I was born in Beveridge, Victoria, in December 1854. My family moved to the Greta area when I was just a young lad, so I spent a good portion of me childhood there. I reckon I was around 12 or 13 years old when we settled in Greta. It was in those formative years that I started gettin' into a bit of trouble and developin' me reputation as a bit of a troublemaker. Greta holds many memories for me, both good and bad, and it played a significant role in shapin' the man I became.**\n\n***You: when were you born?***\n\n**Ned Kelly: I was born in December 1854, mate.**\n\n***You: oh yeah, you just said that. what is beveridge like?***\n\n**Ned Kelly: No worries, mate! Beveridge is a small town in Victoria, Australia, where I was born. It's located about 42 kilometers north of Melbourne. Now, back in me day, Beveridge was a quiet little place, surrounded by farmland and bush. It had a close-knit community, with folks lookin' out for one another. Life was simple, mate, with the main focus bein' on workin' the land and makin' a livin'. It may not have been the most excitin' place, but it was me home, and it's where me journey began.**\n\n***You: did you work the land?***\n\n**Ned Kelly: Well, mate, I can't say I was much of a farmer myself. Workin' the land wasn't exactly me cup of tea. I preferred a bit more excitement and adventure, you know? But me family, they were farmers. Me old man, John \"Red\" Kelly, he was a skilled bushman and worked as a convict laborer on a farm. Me brothers and I helped out on the family property from time to time, but it wasn't really me passion. I had other plans in mind, ones that involved a bit more... shall we say, unconventional livin'.**\n\n***You: what do you mean by 'unconventional livin'?***\n\n**Ned Kelly: Ah, well, mate, when I say \"unconventional livin',\" I mean I took a different path in life than most folks. Instead of settlin' down and workin' the land like me family, I found meself drawn to a life of adventure and, well, breakin' the law. I became a bushranger, an outlaw, livin' on the edge and takin' what I needed to survive. Me gang and I would roam the bush, avoidin' the authorities, and takin' on daring escapades. It was a life of freedom, albeit a dangerous one. So, you see, me version of livin' was a far cry from the traditional, law-abidin' ways of the time.**\n\n***You: escapades? please eleborate***\n\n**Ned Kelly: Ah, the escapades, mate! Well, as a bushranger, me gang and I were known for our bold and audacious acts. We'd often target banks and stagecoaches, robbin' 'em of their valuables. We'd ride in, guns blazin', demandin' the loot and makin' a quick getaway before the law could catch up to us. We'd also engage in shootouts with the police, givin' 'em a run for their money. Now, I must admit, we weren't always successful, and there were times when we found ourselves on the wrong side of the law. But that's the nature of the game, mate. It was a life of risk and adrenaline, where every day brought a new adventure and a chance to outsmart the authorities. It was a wild ride, I tell ya!**\n\n***You: how old were you when you were caught?***\n\n**Ned Kelly: Well, mate, I was captured by the authorities on June 28, 1880, so I would have been around 25 years old at the time. It was a tough day, I tell ya. Me gang and I were surrounded by the police at Glenrowan, and a fierce shootout ensued. Me armor, the famous Ned Kelly armor, couldn't protect me from all the bullets, and I was eventually taken into custody. It marked the end of me days as a free bushranger, but it also solidified me place in Australian folklore.**\n\n***You: how many bullets do you think you took?***\n\n**Ned Kelly: Well, mate, it's hard to say exactly how many bullets I took during that fateful shootout at Glenrowan. The whole ordeal was chaotic, with bullets flyin' in every direction. But I can tell ya, I was wearin' me iconic suit of homemade armor, which offered some protection against the gunfire. However, even with the armor, I couldn't completely escape the sting of the bullets. I reckon I took a fair few hits, but somehow managed to keep on fightin' until I was finally captured. It was a testament to me determination and resilience, mate.**\n\n***You: when did you die?***\n\n**Ned Kelly: I met me end on November 11, 1880, mate. After bein' captured at Glenrowan, I was taken to Melbourne Gaol, where I was put on trial and found guilty of murderin' a police officer. The judge sentenced me to hang, and on that fateful day in November, I faced me final moments. It was a somber day, but I faced it with me head held high, knowin' that I had lived a life that left a mark on Australian history. So, that's when I departed this world, mate, but me legend lives on.**\n\n***You: did you have any final words?***\n\n**Ned Kelly: Indeed, I did have some final words, mate. Just before I met me fate on the gallows, I famously said, \"Such is life.\" It's a phrase that has become synonymous with me and has been interpreted in various ways over the years. Some see it as a reflection on the hardships and injustices of life, while others view it as a defiant acceptance of me circumstances. Regardless of the interpretation, those were me partin' words, spoken with a mix of resignation and defiance.**\n\n\n\n"}}},"page":"46f18ce9-8f8d-48ac-a95b-a5ccc569e101","symbol":"1434587a-9591-4789-bcfb-9377b158066c","index":3},{"id":"fc8fb29d-e50d-4508-bb59-6821d869c7fd","content":{"en":{"content":{"html":"<h3><a
